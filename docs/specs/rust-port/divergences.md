# Differential divergence log

Version: 1. No whole-project old/new differential run has been performed by
this documentation lane. An empty log is not parity evidence.

For each mismatch, append a stable ID and the fields below. Keep fixed entries
as evidence; supersede them by reference rather than erasing them. Fixtures
must redact secrets and bind only named volatile fields. Link retained run
artefacts and CI evidence at the exact candidate and oracle revisions.

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| ID / unit | `RP-<number>`, graph node ID, rulebook version |
| Class | `bug` (Rust defect), `library` (dependency semantics), `python-bug` (old implementation defect, including TS), or `improvement` (intentional new behaviour) |
| Reproducer | Command/MCP transcript, fixture and normaliser revision; platform, config digest and isolated roots |
| Compared revisions | Pinned old revision/binary digest, new head/binary digest and judge revision |
| Expected / actual | Exact differing bytes or schema/value/effect paths, including exit and stderr |
| Evidence | Old-pass/mutant-fail judge proof and differential run artefacts |
| Disposition | Open, fixed (commit and rerun), or approved exception (approver, authority, scope and surviving gate) |
| Follow-up | Regression case and any rulebook/generator amendment |

`bug` and `library` stay blocking until fixed or explicitly approved as a
boundary change. `python-bug` and `improvement` need user approval before the
new behaviour becomes the contract. No lane can approve its own exception.

Existing front-door exceptions D1–D3 are already recorded in
[ADR 0027](../../adr/0027-rust-front-door.md#intentional-divergences-from-the-python-front-door).
They form the current baseline; they are not newly discovered port mismatches.

## RP-1010: telemetry exact numeric counters

- Unit: `scripts/telemetry.py#interface`, `scripts/telemetry_costs.py#unit-01`,
  `scripts/telemetry_report.py#unit-01`; rulebook v2. Class: `bug`.
- Compared revisions: Python and policy tests at
  `e897b10d58b27a46544969594eed08a5ed64c72c`; initial Rust unit commits
  `7b8aabe6`, `541f2f41`, `075f8ed4`; repaired candidate is this PR's head.
- Reproducer/evidence: crate test
  `differential::numeric_boundaries_and_python_float_hash_spelling`, isolated
  in-memory records, pinned Rust toolchain and Python 3.14. No live state.
- Expected/actual: `9007199254740993` must remain exact in retained usage and
  sums. Initial Rust `f64` fields rounded it to `9007199254740992` and could
  collapse adjacent attempt numbers.
- Disposition: fixed with integer/float numeric records, checked exact counter
  sums and exact integer latest-attempt comparisons. Convert to floats at
  pricing/measurement boundaries. The regression rejects the original fields.
- Follow-up: records owner folds `pending::Numeric` into the shared record API;
  full independently owned J2/mutant receipts remain an integration gate.

## RP-1011: telemetry Python float hash spelling

- Unit: `scripts/telemetry_ingest.py#unit-01`; rulebook v2. Class: `bug`.
- Compared revisions: same oracle as RP-1010, initial Rust `3588b22d`, repaired
  candidate is this PR's head.
- Reproducer/evidence: `differential::numeric_boundaries_and_python_float_hash_spelling`
  compares Python SHA-256 over JSON with Rust for `1e-5`, `1e-7`, `1e16`,
  `1e20`, negative zero, Unicode and an exact integer above 2^53.
- Expected/actual: Python hashes `1e-07`; initial Rust hashed `1e-7`.
  A fractional fallback token counter could therefore receive a different ID.
- Disposition: fixed by matching Python's shortest float spelling, exponent
  signs/zero padding and ASCII string escaping. Oracle comparison passes.
- Follow-up: canonical encoder belongs in `provenant-records`; this bounded
  fixture set does not claim exhaustive float-codec/J2 parity.

## RP-1012: telemetry peers accept integral floats

- Unit: `scripts/telemetry_hosts.py#interface`; rulebook v2. Class: `bug`.
- Compared revisions: same oracle as RP-1010, initial Rust `7088692b`, repaired
  candidate is this PR's head.
- Reproducer/evidence: `differential::peer_integral_floats_remain_accepted`.
  Python's peer validator accepts `rows: 1.0` and integral missing-token counts.
- Expected/actual: Rust's validator accepted these numbers but subsequent
  `u64` deserialisation rejected them.
- Disposition: fixed by retaining integer/float numeric count slots through
  typed deserialisation, including integral floats above the u64 range. Regression passes and rejects the old path.
- Follow-up: full peer snapshot/transport conformance is outside this interface
  slice; independently owned J2/mutant receipts remain an integration gate.


## RP-1013: lexical JSON integers beyond u64 remain blocked

- Unit: `scripts/telemetry_hosts.py#interface`, and later JSON/record integration
  for the partial ingestion/report units; rulebook v2. Class: `library`.
- Compared revisions: same Python oracle as RP-1010; Rust candidate is this
  PR's head with default workspace `serde_json` features.
- Reproducer: parse `100000000000000000001` as Python JSON and as
  `serde_json::Value`. Python retains an exact integer; the default Rust Value
  parser converts the lexical integer beyond u64 to an approximate float.
- Expected/actual: peer aggregate counters can exceed one SQLite row's i64
  range. Passing them through Value can silently lose precision before the
  typed numeric visitor sees the input.
- Evidence: independent native repair review identified the Value boundary;
  existing above-2^53 fixtures cover exact i64/u64 records and do not prove
  exact lexical JSON above u64. No independent old-pass/mutant receipt claimed.
- Disposition: **open, blocking affected unit completion and promotion**.
  The hosts interface is partial. No feature expansion, wire narrowing or
  intentional behaviour change is approved. The PR is a draft; no callers or
  live state switch to this crate.
- Follow-up: shared records/integration owner must supply an exact lexical
  number codec or obtain the rulebook/ADR authority for a serde_json feature
  expansion, then add independently owned large-counter conformance fixtures.
