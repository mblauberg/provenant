# Differential divergence log

Version: 1. No whole-project old/new differential run has been performed by
this documentation lane. An empty log is not parity evidence.

For each mismatch, append a stable ID and the fields below. Keep fixed entries
as evidence; supersede them by reference rather than erasing them. Fixtures
must redact secrets and bind only named volatile fields. Link retained run
artefacts and CI evidence at the exact candidate and oracle revisions.

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| ID / unit | `RP-<number>`, graph node ID, rulebook version |
| Class | `bug` (Rust defect), `library` (dependency semantics), `python-bug` (old implementation defect, including TS), or `improvement` (intentional new behaviour) |
| Reproducer | Command/MCP transcript, fixture and normaliser revision; platform, config digest and isolated roots |
| Compared revisions | Pinned old revision/binary digest, new head/binary digest and judge revision |
| Expected / actual | Exact differing bytes or schema/value/effect paths, including exit and stderr |
| Evidence | Old-pass/mutant-fail judge proof and differential run artefacts |
| Disposition | Open, fixed (commit and rerun), or approved exception (approver, authority, scope and surviving gate) |
| Follow-up | Regression case and any rulebook/generator amendment |

`bug` and `library` stay blocking until fixed or explicitly approved as a
boundary change. `python-bug` and `improvement` need user approval before the
new behaviour becomes the contract. No lane can approve its own exception.

Existing front-door exceptions D1–D3 are already recorded in
[ADR 0027](../../adr/0027-rust-front-door.md#intentional-divergences-from-the-python-front-door).
They form the current baseline; they are not newly discovered port mismatches.

## RP-1001 — host identity JSON input (partial unit)

- Unit: `scripts/host_identity.py#unit-01`; rulebook v2 with the inert-crate
  judge-gate override from rulebook v3 / PR #1294.
- Class: `library`. Source/oracle revision:
  `e897b10d58b27a46544969594eed08a5ed64c72c`.
- Reproducer: in `tools/front-door`, run
  `cargo test -j 2 -p provenant-core python_extended_host_json -- --ignored`.
  Uses isolated temporary hosts files and the repository's Python module.
- Expected/actual: Python accepts UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16/32 byte encodings, nonfinite
  numbers, and lone surrogate escapes in otherwise unused members. The current
  UTF-8/serde reader rejects these and falls back to the hostname slug.
- Evidence: executable Python differential reproducer retained as an ignored,
  failing parity test. Ordinary host policy and duplicate-member fixtures pass.
  No independent old-pass/mutant-fail judge evidence is claimed.
- Disposition: open; this unit is partial and must not cut over. Slugs, name
  validation, strict duplicate detection, fallback, aliases and peer exclusion
  are ported. A compatibility representation/input decoder remains; no
  feature expansion or new dependency is authorised by this entry.

## RP-1002 — JSONC value representation and diagnostics (partial unit)

- Unit: `scripts/lib/jsonc.py#unit-01`; same rulebook and oracle as RP-1001.
- Class: `library`.
- Reproducer: `cargo test -j 2 -p provenant-core python_extended_jsonc_values
  -- --ignored` in `tools/front-door`.
- Expected/actual: Python accepts `NaN`, infinities, arbitrary-size integers
  (subject to its interpreter limit), overflow-to-infinity floats, and lone
  surrogate escapes. The current serde value model rejects or rounds these.
  Generic syntax errors also retain serde diagnostics rather than Python's
  message, character offset, line and column. Unterminated block comments
  already carry Python-compatible character positions.
- Evidence: ignored differential test demonstrates the value acceptance gap;
  active differential fixtures cover comments, escaped strings, duplicate
  members, malformed syntax and trailing commas. Judge evidence is deferred.
- Disposition: open; partial syntax port only. Value representation and edge
  error rendering remain. No changed contract is approved.

## RP-1003 — product pointer JSON/path encoding (partial unit)

- Unit: `scripts/lib/product_root_resolver.py#unit-01`; same rulebook and oracle
  as RP-1001.
- Class: `library`.
- Reproducer: `cargo test -j 2 -p provenant-core python_extended_pointer_json_and_non_utf8_paths
  -- --ignored` in `tools/front-door` on Unix. The fixture creates a product
  directory with byte `0xff` in its name when the filesystem permits it; the
  numeric fixture is independent of filename support.
- Expected/actual: Python writes the path using surrogateescape and JSON ASCII
  escapes, then reads it back. Rust currently returns `PointerError::Encoding`
  for that path and cannot read lone surrogate escapes. Nonfinite/overflow
  numbers or lone surrogates in unused JSON members likewise cause Rust to
  reject a pointer Python accepts.
- Evidence: the numeric differential fails; non-UTF-8 filename creation was
  refused by the local filesystem and that subcase is unverified locally.
  Active byte comparison covers Unicode
  paths. Policy tests cover stale pointers, invalid versions/types, containment,
  linked-directory refusals, linked-file replacement, private file modes and
  concurrent publication. Judge evidence is deferred.
- Disposition: open; pointer loading/writing for ordinary UTF-8 JSON paths is
  ported, including atomic publication. Non-UTF-8 record encoding and the shared
  JSON adaptation remain. The private `pending::atomic_write` belongs in
  `provenant-supervisor` once its safe publication API exists on main.
## RP-1001 - Python refusal string escaping

- Unit: `scripts/lane_safety_guard.py#unit-01`, rulebook version 2.
- Class: `bug` (fixed; no contract change).
- Reproducer: `cargo test -j 2 -p provenant-cli decisions_match_python_source_on_adversarial_argv`
  from `tools/front-door`, Python 3.14.8 / Unicode 16.0.0, macOS arm64.
  The fixture passes a single U+200B target, with no filesystem or volatile-field
  normalisation and no provider/config access.
- Compared revisions: Python source and policy oracle
  `5c48d4e5567c4801b072bbf88203e88822079ab1`; faulty Rust policy
  `b2ed1154`; fixed implementation and differential fixture
  `d789ac2cef086e955f1ac1ba8fe23c440dc05dbf`.
- Expected: `kill target '\u200b' is not a literal PID`, with ASCII escape
  bytes. Actual: the target contained literal UTF-8 `e2 80 8b` instead.
- Evidence: the retained differential test failed on this exact comparison
  before repair and passes after repair. `repr_and_strip_match_python_on_control_and_unicode_boundaries`
  adds 377 character/string fixtures, including controls and supplementary
  Unicode. The generated printable-property table pins the oracle's Unicode
  version instead of relying on Rust's differing character properties.
- Disposition: fixed in `d789ac2c`. Independent J1 acceptance remains pending;
  these lane differential fixtures do not replace the independent judge.
- Follow-up: move the private compatibility primitives to `provenant-core`
  during integration; retain the differential cases. No rule amendment or
  intentional exception is requested.

## RP-1002 - Cleanup request error classification

- Unit: `scripts/clean.py#interface`, rulebook version 2.
- Class: `bug` (fixed; no contract change).
- Reproducer: `cargo test -j 2 -p provenant-cli invalid_request_error_classes_match_python_streams_and_exit_codes`
  from `tools/front-door`, Python 3.14.8, macOS arm64. Fixtures use only
  invalid arguments, before any plan, Git query or deletion is attempted.
- Compared revisions: Python oracle
  `5c48d4e5567c4801b072bbf88203e88822079ab1`; faulty renderer
  `d789ac2c`; repair and differential test
  `a79987fea684086aa696b4400e3ed265d713d83c`.
- Expected / actual: approval-pair, prune-options and unexpected-selector
  failures use parser usage plus `clean.py: error: ...`, exit 2. Rust's generic
  renderer instead emitted `provenant clean: ...`. Missing-selector text was
  already correct and remains the special case without usage.
- Evidence: native source-parity review identified the classification error;
  four source differential cases now compare stdout, stderr and exit codes.
  Usage is an explicit parser-owner input; usage/help generation is still
  listed as partial, not claimed as ported by this test.
- Disposition: fixed in `a79987fe`; native repair review is clean. Independent
  J1 acceptance remains pending. No intentional exception is requested.

## RP-2001 - Quarantine paths lost Unix filename bytes

- Unit: `skills/orchestrate/scripts/instruction_quarantine.py#interface`,
  rulebook version 3.
- Class: `bug` (fixed; no intended contract change).
- Reproducer: `cargo test -j 2 -p provenant-confinement non_utf8_instruction_names_survive_restore_and_index_framing`
  from `tools/front-door`, macOS arm64, Python oracle selected by `python3`.
  Fixture paths contain literal bytes `ff` and `fe` below `.agents/`.
- Compared revisions: Python oracle
  `9b2da713b4cc3b188b1c8697eb7c6755ec0d8b0d`; faulty Rust interface
  `d91b9dfbc1e744f7ee70d36f0fdfafe893050726`; repair is the commit adding this entry.
- Expected / actual: Python's surrogateescape round trip retains these bytes
  in restore-view keys and NUL-framed index input. Rust `String` keys could
  not represent them and `.as_bytes()` could not reproduce their framing.
- Evidence: native adversarial review identified the restriction. The added
  regression exercises integration, restored views, quarantinability and
  byte-for-byte framing against Python `_index_info` on the same fixture.
- Disposition: fixed using `OsString` keys and raw Unix bytes. Snapshot values
  are in-memory interface values; they emit no JSON here. The record owner
  must supply the Python-compatible filename wire encoding before persistence
  is integrated. No replacement JSON encoding is introduced.
- Follow-up: retain the differential regression. Independent J2 schema and
  mutant evidence remains a cut-over gate; this lane does not claim it.

### RP-2001 follow-up - Preserve index caller order

- Repair review found a second framing mismatch: `BTreeSet<OsString>` sorted
  raw bytes, while the Python runtime sorts surrogateescaped strings. Valid
  U+0080 sorts before surrogateescaped byte `80` in Python; raw byte order
  reverses them. Both produce the same Git index, but different input bytes.
- Class: `bug` (fixed). Faulty repair: `c8eaafd0`; oracle unchanged from RP-2001.
- Disposition: `index_info` now takes an ordered slice, preserving its caller's
  order exactly as Python `_index_info` does. The later quarantine runtime
  supplies Python-sorted changes; the interface does not silently sort them.
- Evidence: `index_framing_preserves_python_caller_order_for_mixed_names`
  compares the mixed-name framing with Python and checks caller order is
  retained. This supplements the original invalid-byte regression.
