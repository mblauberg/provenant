# Differential divergence log

Version: 1. No whole-project old/new differential run has been performed by
this documentation lane. An empty log is not parity evidence.

For each mismatch, append a stable ID and the fields below. Keep fixed entries
as evidence; supersede them by reference rather than erasing them. Fixtures
must redact secrets and bind only named volatile fields. Link retained run
artefacts and CI evidence at the exact candidate and oracle revisions.

| Field | Required content |
|---|---|
| ID / unit | `RP-<number>`, graph node ID, rulebook version |
| Class | `bug` (Rust defect), `library` (dependency semantics), `python-bug` (old implementation defect, including TS), or `improvement` (intentional new behaviour) |
| Reproducer | Command/MCP transcript, fixture and normaliser revision; platform, config digest and isolated roots |
| Compared revisions | Pinned old revision/binary digest, new head/binary digest and judge revision |
| Expected / actual | Exact differing bytes or schema/value/effect paths, including exit and stderr |
| Evidence | Old-pass/mutant-fail judge proof and differential run artefacts |
| Disposition | Open, fixed (commit and rerun), or approved exception (approver, authority, scope and surviving gate) |
| Follow-up | Regression case and any rulebook/generator amendment |

`bug` and `library` stay blocking until fixed or explicitly approved as a
boundary change. `python-bug` and `improvement` need user approval before the
new behaviour becomes the contract. No lane can approve its own exception.

Existing front-door exceptions D1–D3 are already recorded in
[ADR 0027](../../adr/0027-rust-front-door.md#intentional-divergences-from-the-python-front-door).
They form the current baseline; they are not newly discovered port mismatches.

## RP-FR1-001: generic gate-extension JSON numbers (open, library)

- Unit: `runtime/fabric/src/graph/gates.ts#unit-01` (partial), rulebook v2.
- Compared source/oracle: `e897b10d58b27a46544969594eed08a5ed64c72c`;
  candidate: the `port/fabric-runtime-1` batch, `gates::parse_gate_exit`.
- Reproducer: an exit record with a matching token, string `finished_at` and
  an extension field `"n":1e400`. Node `JSON.parse` accepts the number as
  Infinity; generic `serde_json::Value` rejects it. Large finite integers also
  have different JavaScript rounding semantics. This is not an accepted change.
- Expected/actual: TS returns the record; the current partial Rust decoder can
  return no record for an out-of-range number. Normal typed gate exit codes do
  not exercise this extension-field case.
- Evidence: the parser probe recorded in the batch's local verification log;
  no independent mutant judge is claimed for this remaining boundary.
- Disposition: open and blocking completion/cut-over of the gate unit. Preserve
  the partial designation. The integration owner must settle the response codec
  and add the boundary judge before claiming this unit fully ported.
